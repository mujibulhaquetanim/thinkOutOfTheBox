You are given an array of Integers and another integer targetValue. Write a
function that will take these inputs and return the indices of the 2 integers in
the array that add up targetValue. 

conditions:
What if no two integers add up to the targetValue? -- returns empty array
Will multiple pairs of integers add up to the targetValue? -- no at most one pair
Are all numbers positive? -- no, can have negative integers too.
are the integers distinct? -- yes.
